# The Odin Project: Mailchimp signup page project in HTML/CSS
Odin Project HTML/CSS project

Live site here: [Mailchimp signup](https://ikass.github.io/mailchimp-signup/)

## What I learneed:

- Wanted to build purely in Flexbox
- First struggle was laying out the picture and form content
- Next I had difficulty making the signup button a normal size, it kept stretching vertically, both when I tried Flexbox and Grid for the layout. Still not sure what was the issue and did I fix it correctly by using 'align-self: start'.
- The major challenge was to properly align the signup button and the checkbox with text. had to use Grid.

> Note to self: learn more about Grid Layout and Flexbox differences and best use cases.
