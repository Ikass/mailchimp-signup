# The Odin Project: Mailchimp signup page project in HTML/CSS
Odin Project HTML/CSS project

Live site here: [Mailchimp signup](https://ikass.github.io/mailchimp-signup/)

## What I learneed:

- wanted to build purely in Flexbox
- First struggle was laying out the picture and form content
- the major challenge was to properly align the signup button and the checkbox with text. had to use Grid.

> Note to self: learn more about Grid Layout and Flexbox differences and best use cases.
